Adapter Pattern:
	1. Works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
	2. This comes under structural design pattern as this combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
	3. This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or 
	   incompatible interfaces. Ex: A real world example could be a case of Card Reader which acts as an adapter
	   between memory card and laptop. You plugs-in the Memory Card into card reader and card reader into laptop
	   so that memory card can be read via laptop.
